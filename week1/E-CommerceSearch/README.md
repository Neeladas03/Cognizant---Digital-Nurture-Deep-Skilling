# E-Commerce Search

This project simulates a basic product search feature in an e-commerce platform using two algorithms: linear search and binary search.

A list of products is stored with fields such as product ID, name, and category. Linear search is applied on an unsorted list, while binary search is performed on a sorted list for comparison. The goal is to analyze and understand the efficiency differences between the two methods.

The project shows how algorithm choice affects performance, especially as the dataset grows. Binary search offers faster results on sorted data, making it more suitable for real-world applications with large inventories.
