# Financial Forecasting

This project calculates the future value of an investment using a recursive algorithm. Given a starting amount, an annual growth rate, and the number of years, it predicts the future amount using both recursive and optimized memoized approaches.

The project focuses on demonstrating how recursion can simplify repetitive calculations in forecasting scenarios. It also introduces the concept of memoization to avoid redundant computations, making the algorithm more efficient.

This implementation offers a foundation for understanding recursive thinking in financial modeling and highlights the trade-offs between simplicity and performance.
